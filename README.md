# AdvancedProfileRyan

For this project we had to build our own portfolio showing projects we have worked on and giving a little information about ourself.
I worked a lot with stle.css on this own trying to figure out how to have multiple colors and how to change the size of images and how to mive them around.
I'm not fully happy with how it turnd out but have learned a lot and know a little more about how to creat a page and how to change elements on the page.
